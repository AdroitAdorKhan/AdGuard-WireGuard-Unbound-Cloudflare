### I thought Iâ€™d create a guide on these network security projects because _`we are in more and more risk of falling victim of data theft and sabotage network security`_. Network security helps protect your workstations from harmful spyware and viruses. It's important to note that enhanced browsing security is vital for everyone for everyday use. Keeping files free from infection is particularly important in todayâ€™s collaborative workplace. If an unauthorized user gains access to your computer, they have the potential to steal valuable information, including your identity and cause permanent damage to your computer's system.

### The best way to get rid of _`intrusive ads and online tracking, and to protect your computer from malware`_. It will deal with annoying banners, pop-ups and video ads once and for all.

### A virtual private network (VPN) gives you online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network from a public internet connection. Most important, VPN services establish _`secure and encrypted connections`_ to provide greater privacy than even a secured Wi-Fi hotspot. It scrambles data so that a hackers cannot tell what a person is doing online when attacking with middle man attack or some sort of sniffing tool.

### DNS plays a critical part of almost every aspect of your Internet experience. Every time you visit a website, send an e-mail, or do almost anything on the Internet, DNS is there to help you get to the right place. DNS security is important because it links the domain name to the IP. Internet criminals can exploit these weaknesses and are capable of creating false DNS records. These fake records can trick users into visiting _`fake websites, downloading malicious software, or worse`_. Unlike the DNS servers from your  ISP, custom DNS(Cloudflare/OpenDns/GoogleDns.etc) servers store the IP addresses of millions of websites in their cache so it would take less time to resolve your requests. Another huge advantage of using a custom DNS is that it blocks phishing websites from loading on your computer.
